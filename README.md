# Project Euler
A collection of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions in x86
assembly.

## Overview
This repo contains my solutions to the Project Euler problems in x86 assembly.
This is primarily a learning tool, used to expand my knowledge of x86 assembly
and systems programming.

## Solutions
 1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](001/README.md)
 2. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](002/README.md)
